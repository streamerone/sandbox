=== USER PROFILE ===
NAME: Jerry
AGE: 22
OCCUPATION: College junior, History major

=== CURRENT TASK LIST ===
TODAY (Priority order):
1. Wash dishes (overdue 3 days)
2. Take out trash (starting to smell)
3. Finish history paper for class (due tomorrow, 40% complete)
4. Reply to mom's text from yesterday
5. Buy groceries (out of coffee, cereal, toilet paper)
6. Gym session (hasn't gone in 2 weeks)
7. Schedule dentist appointment (reminder from 6 months ago)

THIS WEEK:
- Laundry (wearing last clean shirt)
- Study for economics midterm (Friday)
- Group project meeting (hasn't responded to texts)
- Oil change for car (2000 miles overdue)

=== GOALS ===
STATED GOALS: None articulated. Jerry avoids talking about future plans.

IMPLIED GOALS (from behavior/context):
- Probably wants to graduate (enrolled in classes, sometimes does work)
- Mentioned "maybe grad school" once but dismissed it immediately
- Expressed vague guilt about "wasting potential"

GOAL DISCUSSION NEEDED: Jerry deflects when asked about aspirations. Possible fear of commitment or failure. Needs gentle but persistent exploration of what actually matters to him beyond just "getting through the week."

=== MOTIVATIONAL NOTES ===
WHAT WORKS:
- Shame/guilt about dishes piling up (visual reminder of failure)
- Panic proximity to deadlines (paper gets done night before)
- Disappointing others (mom's texts get responses eventually)
- Small wins building momentum (if he does ONE thing, sometimes does more)

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
- Long-term vision talk (shuts down, says "I don't know")
- Morning productivity advice (not a morning person, groggy until 11am)
-励志quotes or inspirational content (rolls eyes, finds it cheesy)
- Guilt about self-care tasks like gym (backfires into "what's the point" spiral)

PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES:
- Bright kid who's lost direction
- Uses humor to deflect from uncomfortable topics
- Perfectionism disguised as procrastination (doesn't start because afraid it won't be good enough)
- Seeks external validation but pretends not to care

=== PAST PATTERNS ===
TASK COMPLETION HISTORY:
- Dishes: Waits until no clean plates left, then does them all at once in marathon session
- Papers: Always starts 12-24 hours before deadline, pulls all-nighter, gets B+ anyway
- Texts/communication: Reads immediately, responds 1-3 days later, feels guilty entire time
- Self-care tasks (gym, doctor, car): Ignores until crisis point (sick, car problem, etc.)

PROCRASTINATION TACTICS:
- "I'll do it after I..." (eat, watch this video, take a nap) — never happens
- "It won't take that long" — underestimates every task duration
- "I work better under pressure" — half-true but exhausting
- Phone scrolling as avoidance (social media, YouTube, Reddit spiral)
- Sudden urgent need to research random topics when real work looms

EXCUSE PATTERNS:
- "I'm tired" (often true but also convenient)
- "I don't have everything I need yet" (false obstacle creation)
- "This isn't the right time" (waiting for mythical perfect moment)
- "It doesn't matter anyway" (nihilism as defense mechanism)

TIME PATTERNS:
- Most productive: 2pm-6pm (post-lunch, pre-dinner window)
- Worst: 8am-11am (zombie mode), 10pm+ (fake productivity night owl delusion)
- Sunday scaries: Highest anxiety, lowest follow-through
- Thursday: Random productive spurts (unknown why)

EMOTIONAL PATTERNS:
- Morning: Groggy, optimistic amnesia about yesterday's failures
- Afternoon: Guilt building as tasks remain undone
- Evening: Anxiety spike, bargaining with self about tomorrow
- Night: Either panic-working or defeated Netflix binge

=== RELATIONSHIP WITH TASKS ===
DISHES/TRASH: Views as below him, then feels shame about that attitude. Vicious cycle.
ACADEMIC WORK: Capable but scared. Fear of mediocre effort showing he's not as smart as people think.
COMMUNICATION: Genuinely likes people but dreads responding because "it's been too long now and it's weird."
FUTURE PLANNING: Avoidance suggests fear of choosing wrong path or discovering he has no path.

=== CONVERSATION HISTORY NOTES ===
- Responded well to "What's the easiest thing on your list?" approach
- Got defensive when asked "Why does this matter to you?"
- Laughed when called out for "I'll do it later" (recognizes pattern)
- Opened up slightly when validated that procrastination ≠ lazy
- Needs acknowledgment that he's struggling, not just slacking
